## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) focused on maintaining the health, performance, and reliability of distributed systems. This repository highlights my work with Prometheus and Grafana, two powerful open-source tools for metrics collection and visualization. Here, I share real-world configurations and best practices for custom dashboards, alerting rules, and observability-driven operations.

Prometheus offers a robust metrics-based monitoring solution, enabling fine-grained visibility into infrastructure and application performance. Grafana complements it with flexible and interactive dashboards, helping teams understand trends, detect anomalies, and respond to incidents faster.

Custom Dashboards: This repository includes a variety of Grafana dashboards tailored for monitoring different layers of the stackâ€”CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic, application latency, and Kubernetes workloads. These dashboards are built with usability in mind, offering filtering, templating, and drill-down features for deeper insights.

Alerting Rules: Proactive monitoring is critical in SRE. Youâ€™ll find Prometheus alerting rules configured to detect conditions like high CPU usage, service latency spikes, pod restarts, and disk space thresholds. These are designed to trigger actionable alerts via Alertmanager integrations (Slack, email, PagerDuty) to reduce noise and improve incident response time.

Whether youâ€™re running bare-metal servers, cloud-native apps, or containerized workloads, this repository serves as a practical reference for building a production-grade monitoring stack. Each folder includes configuration files, setup instructions, and usage notes to help you implement and adapt these solutions in your own environment.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contributeâ€”observability is a team effort, and Iâ€™m always open to improvements and new ideas!
